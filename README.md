OpenFly
=======

Purpose
-------

This is a very simply Fly plugin. At the moment it simply allows players to /fly without giving them full creative mode. It includes a permission node for choosing who you want to be able to fly and when and where, etc.

Commands
--------

 - /fly - Use to toggle fly

Permissions
-----------

 - openfly.fly - Allow the player to use the /fly command

How to Install
--------------

Download the jar file. Place it in your plugins directory and restart your server. Now your players can /fly. Note that this plugin uses metrics which can be disabled in the config.yml file.

Planned Features
----------------

Theoretically, I'll eventually add some more features:

 - Charging for fly using Vault compatible economy
 - Configuration of strings, etc.

Why Another Fly Plugin
----------------------

Because I couldn't find one that was properly open source. Speaking of source, here's a link to the code on GitHub. Fork it, abuse it, do what you like. https://github.com/nyvaria/OpenFly

Known Bugs
----------

None at this time.
